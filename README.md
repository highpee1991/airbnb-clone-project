## Team Roles
**Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.**
**Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.**
**DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.**
**QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.**


## Technology Stack
**Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.**
**Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.**
**PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.**
**GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.**
**Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.**
**Redis: Used for caching and session management.**
**Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.**
**CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.**


## Feature Overview
**1. API Documentation**
**OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.**
**Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.**
**GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.**
**2. User Authentication**
**Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/**
**Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.**
**3. Property Management**
**Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/**
**Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.**
**4. Booking System**
**Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/**
**Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.**
**5. Payment Processing**
**Endpoints: /payments/**
**Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.**
**6. Review System**
**Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/**
**Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.**
**7. Database Optimizations**
**Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.**
**Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.**



## Database Design
**User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.**
**Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.**
**Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.**
**Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.**
**Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.**
**Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.**

## API Security
**<sub>Authentication:	Verifies who is making the request,	Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the system Example Methods: API keys, OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</sub>**
**<sub>Authorization:	Verifies what they can do,	Prevents users from accessing or modifying data improperly Example Methods: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), OAuth scopes</sub>**
**<sub>Rate Limiting	Controls how much they can request,	Prevents abuse, maintains system stabilityExample Methods: Fixed window limit (e.g., 1000 requests per hour), Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms, IP-based or API key-based rate limiting</sub>**



## CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD pipelines significantly enhance software development by automating crucial processes like code integration, testing, and deployment, leading to faster release cycles, reduced errors, and improved collaboration**
**Tools that can be used**
**GitHub Actions**
**GitHub GitLab CI/CD**
**GitHub Jenkins**
**GitHub CircleCI**
**GitHub Travis CI**
**GitHub Azure DevOps**
**GitHub Bitbucket Pipelines**
