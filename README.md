## Feature Breakdown

1) **API Documentation**  
   - OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.  
   - Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.  
   - GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

2) **User Authentication**  
   - Endpoints: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`  
   - Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

3) **Property Management**  
   - Endpoints: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`  
   - Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

4) **Booking System**  
   - Endpoints: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`  
   - Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

5) **Payment Processing**  
   - Endpoints: `/payments/`  
   - Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

6) **Review System**  
   - Endpoints: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`  
   - Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

7) **Database Optimizations**  
   - Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.  
   - Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## Database Design

1) User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
2) Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.  
3) Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.**  
4) Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.  
5) Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
6) Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## API Security

1) **Authentication:** Verifies who is making the request, prevents unauthorized users from accessing the system  
   - Example Methods: API keys, OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

2) **Authorization:** Verifies what they can do, prevents users from accessing or modifying data improperly  
   - Example Methods: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), OAuth scopes

3) **Rate Limiting:** Controls how much they can request, prevents abuse, maintains system stability  
   - Example Methods: Fixed window limit (e.g., 1000 requests per hour), Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms, IP-based or API key-based rate limiting
